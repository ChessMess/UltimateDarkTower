# Assets Directory

This directory contains assets for the example applications.

## Required Files for Examples

The example HTML files reference the following assets:

- `azkolskerning7-webfont.woff` - Custom font for tower controller
- `azkolskerning7-webfont.woff2` - Custom font for tower controller
- `background.jpeg` - Background image for tower controller

## Note

These assets are not included in the repository. You can:

1. Add your own font and background image files with these names
2. Or modify the HTML files in `examples/` to use different assets
3. Or remove the asset references entirely

The examples will still function without these assets, but may not display as intended.
